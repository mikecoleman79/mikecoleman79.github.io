  <div class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I led the redevelopment of a member reporting platform for a financial services
      organisation, replacing a manual Excel-based reporting process with a secure,
      web-based system built on WordPress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform allows member organisations (banks) to submit annual and bi-annual
      financial reports through a private members area, with structured data capture,
      validation, persistence and reporting tools for administrators.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The client’s existing workflow relied on large, complex Excel spreadsheets to collect
      financial data from members. These were manually completed, emailed back and processed
      offline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key issues included:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>High risk of data entry errors and inconsistent formatting</li>
      <li>No ability to partially complete and return to submissions</li>
      <li>Manual validation and checking of financial data</li>
      <li>Static tables on the website with no live reporting</li>
      <li>No secure, member-specific access to historical submissions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The client needed a scalable, repeatable reporting system that could replace Excel
      entirely while remaining easy for non-technical users to complete.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Complex financial models had to be accurately replicated online</li>
      <li>Reports needed to support both annual and bi-annual submissions</li>
      <li>Members could only access and view their own data</li>
      <li>The system had to support drafts, saved progress and resuming later</li>
      <li>Submitted data needed to be reusable for reporting and export</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Solution</h2>

    <h3>Private Members Area & Access Control</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Creation of a dedicated members-only user role</li>
      <li>Page-level and data-level access restrictions</li>
      <li>Users mapped to specific member organisations</li>
      <li>Members restricted to viewing and editing their own reports only</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advanced Multi-Step Reporting Form</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-step Gravity Form designed to mirror the existing Excel spreadsheet</li>
      <li>Save and continue functionality allowing users to return later</li>
      <li>Custom field validation for financial inputs</li>
      <li>Summary and review step prior to final submission</li>
      <li>Automated email notifications on save and submission</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Storage & Modelling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Custom post type for members</li>
      <li>Custom post type for member reports</li>
      <li>Each form submission stored as structured, queryable data</li>
      <li>Clear relationship between users, members and reports</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reporting, Tables & Exports</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Admin-facing reporting tables powered by DataTables.js</li>
      <li>Filtering, sorting and searching across submissions</li>
      <li>Export of member reports to CSV for analysis</li>
      <li>Export of individual member reports to PDF for records and compliance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Admin & Operational Tooling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Backend views for saved (draft) and submitted reports</li>
      <li>Manual entry tools for testing and data verification</li>
      <li>Clear separation between submission, review and reporting workflows</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fully replaced Excel-based reporting with a secure web platform</li>
      <li>Improved data accuracy through validation and structured inputs</li>
      <li>Reduced manual administration and follow-up with members</li>
      <li>Created a scalable reporting system for future reporting cycles</li>
      <li>Enabled members to manage and review their submissions independently</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>
      Due to confidentiality, screenshots and live access are not publicly available.
      The architecture, data modelling and workflow design can be discussed in more
      detail on request.
